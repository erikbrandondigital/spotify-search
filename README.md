# Spotify Search

## Project Overview

This project uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web/api) to allow users to search for music within Spotify's music library. The project contains a React frontend that provides users with the ability to sign in to the application using OAuth, providing access to their Spotify account. Upon signing in, users will then be able to search for music by Artist, Album, Track Name, etc. All search and OAuth requests are handled by an Express backend API which acts as a middleman between the application frontend and Spotify's Web APIs.

## Install

To get the project up and running make sure that you have all of the required prerequisites listed in the previous section installed on your system. Then follow the steps below:

1. Clone the **main** branch of the repo to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/erikbrandondigital/spotify-search.git
```

2. Open the **Project Folder**:

```
cd spotify-search
```

3. Create two **.env** files in the **api** and **reactjs** folders by copying & renaming each **.env.example** file to **.env**.

```
cp api/.env.example api/.env && cp reactjs/.env.example reactjs/.env
```

4. Update the Environment Variables in each folder to your desired settings using the [Environment Variables Reference](#environment-variables-reference) section.
   - Don't forget to add your Spotify Developer **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to the **API .env** file.
5. Run `docker-compose up --build -d` to build and start the application.
   - You can skip the `--build` flag if you already built the application before or the `-d` flag if you want to attach to the Docker container when the application starts up.

## Uninstall

To uninstall the project, follow the steps below:

1. Run `docker-compose down -v` to stop and delete the running Docker containers and the network and storage volumes.
   - You can skip the `-v` flag if you want to keep the data stored in the database.
2. Delete the project folder from your machine and uninstall anything in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section that you no longer want to keep.
